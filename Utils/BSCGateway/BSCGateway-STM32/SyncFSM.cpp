/*

SyncFSM.cpp 

Handles finding the sync position. When in sync it will dispatch the receivedSyncData for each character received. Typically
used by the message FSM.
 
The Sync FSM has two states, Hunt state and Sync state. When in Hunt state it will search for the BSC SYNC characters, SYN SYN, 0x32 0x32.

  // Reception is a bit strange since we are not getting the bits on proper byte bounderies we need shift the bits to get them right.
  // In hardware there are a 16 bit shift register that in which the data are clocked in from the line and then matched with the sync sequence.
  // While in software we need to handle it a bit differentlty since we get bits in chunks of bytes.
  // On the serial line the LSB of the byte is transmitted first and thus received first in the receiver. If we use the LSBFIRST setting
  // for the SPI transmitting works great but not reception. The order of the bits on the line would not line up well when the bytes are concatenated in a 16 or 32 bit word

  //        The same number of 0 indicate the same pattern, but scrambled. We will never be able to find a matching sequence
  //        And we cannot shift the bits in the processor to find our bits belonging to one byte
  // 
  // This all boils down is to use MSBFIRST since it will fit better with how the shifting takes place in the processor

  // If we then use the LSB converted bit pattern for the sync char (0x3232)  0x4c4c we can easily use shift operations
  // to find the bit in the word where sync is matching.
