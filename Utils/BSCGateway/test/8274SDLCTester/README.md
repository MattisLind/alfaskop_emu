# 8274 SDLC Tester

A simple test bench using th Ericsson TWIB card to test things back to back against the software SDLC implementation inside the STM32 microcontroller.

Can also be used for simple testing towards the Informer 213 terminal , by implementeing a send SNRM, recveive a UA, send a ACTPU, receive response sequence.

This test program is work in progress. Make sure to press the R command to RESET the 8274 chip and init it properly prior to try to send and receive anything.
