# Utilities

This folder contains a number of small utilities used during the development.

## 3274emu
This is a test to test out the BSC interfacing towards Hercules. It is a quick and dirty implementation of a IBM 3274 control unit. Instead of real 3270 terminals it accespts telnet sessions from TN3270 clients.

## AlfaskopCommander
A tool to exercise the HDLC chip on the Ericsson TWIB card to send simple message to the terminal.

## BSCGateway
The bridge between BSC over TCP to BSC over synchronous serial connection.

## Dasms
Disassembly of the various EPROM and binary files of the ALfaskop unit.

## HerculesIntegration
Some simple code that later on eveloved into 3274emu. Used to test out the BSC over TCP implementation.

## SDLCBridge
An implementation of an SDLC capable USB interface.
